---------------------
libbadcfg version 0.1
---------------------

Please note: this library was written years ago.  I uploaded it mostly
             because it is needed by SlashDoc

libbadcfg is a small library that reads configuration files in the following
form:

	foo = "bar"
	moo
	{
		voo = "doo"
	}
	spam = "no"
	{
		yes = "but"
	}
	
The library's source code is released in Public Domain. Do whatever you want
with it, but keep in mind that there is no warranty that it actually works.

To build type:

	make
	
To build the docs type:

	make docs
	

To build the docs you'll need SlashDOC from
	http://github.com/badsector/slashdoc
